For client from Canada

The website fantasyhelper.net provides fantasy baseball data.  I want this data in a google sheet for other processing.

Currently I go to this site daily and get the data 16 times. Each time requires multiple clicks and cut/paste of the data.  I would like a script that automates this task.  The data is presented in a tabular format and is available for download - there is no translation of the data required.

When the data is loaded into a google sheet, I would like one extra column indicating the current date.

See attached screenshot for the steps to get the data.
